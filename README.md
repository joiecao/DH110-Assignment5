# Assignment05: Low Fidelity Prototype
### DH110, Joie Cao

## Intro

**Purpose:** The purpose my project is to develop a beginner friendly PC building app that helps users to learn, purchase, and build their first PCs. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to put my initial ideas on paper and test it with a user to better understand their experience and interaction with my designs. This prototype will be an app, as I imagine users taking their PC parts list (like a shopping list) into stores to search for the right products. Additionally, while assembling, an app provides quick and easy reference. 

**User Personas:** Users of my app will be curious PC builders of all ages but mostly young adults. I expect some to be migrating from MacOS and most users to be inexperienced beginners. 

**Features & Tasks:** 

1. Experience quiz- a short, 3 question quiz to determine the experience level of a new user, budget, and assessing the purpose of their build (ie gaming, art, streaming, etc). 

2. Part Picker Tool- Suggest a build with parts based on the user's quiz results. The user will be able to edit the build and see similar recommended items.

3. Tutorial Hub- a place to browse helpful articles and videos.
